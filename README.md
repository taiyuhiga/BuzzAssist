# BuzzAssist

BuzzAssist is a local Excalidraw canvas and media MCP plugin for Codex and Claude Code, modeled after Cowart's architecture:

- official Excalidraw MCP App access through `https://mcp.excalidraw.com/mcp`
- a local static React canvas service
- project-local canvas persistence under `canvas/`
- MCP tools for Codex to read selection state, insert assets, and generate images/videos
- Codex and Claude Code plugin manifests with shared skills

## Agent URL Setup

This repo is designed so a user can pass the GitHub URL to Codex or Claude Code
and say "set it up." The agent should clone/open the repo and run:

```text
https://github.com/taiyuhiga/BuzzAssist
```

```bash
node scripts/setup-agents.mjs --project-dir /path/to/active/project
```

The setup script installs dependencies when needed, builds the canvas UI when
needed, refreshes a lightweight local plugin source at `~/plugins/buzzassist`,
installs `buzzassist@personal` into Codex, installs
`buzzassist@buzzassist-local` into Claude Code, starts the local canvas server,
and prints:

```text
BUZZASSIST_CANVAS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/
```

After that, the current host agent should open the printed URL in its in-app
browser. If browser control is unavailable, use the URL from
`canvas/.server.json`.

## Run The Canvas

```bash
# macOS / Linux
./scripts/start-canvas.sh /path/to/user/project

# any OS (Windows included)
node scripts/start-canvas.mjs /path/to/user/project

# after packaging / install
npx buzzassist-canvas-mcp
npx buzzassist-canvas /path/to/user/project
```

Default URL, when available:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:43219/
```

If that port is already busy, the canvas server selects the next available
local port and writes the live URL, HTTP MCP URL, and bearer token to:

```text
canvas/.server.json
```

Project-local data:

```text
canvas/excalidraw-canvas.json
canvas/excalidraw-selection.json
canvas/excalidraw-view-state.json
canvas/assets/
```

## MCP Tools

This plugin includes two Excalidraw MCP entries:

- `excalidraw_official`: the official open-source Excalidraw MCP App hosted by Excalidraw, useful for prompt-to-diagram generation and MCP App rendering
- `excalidraw_mcp`: this repository's local project-bound stdio MCP server. It auto-starts the browser canvas when needed.

The local stdio MCP runs on `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, so initialization,
tool listing/calling, protocol negotiation, and `notifications/progress` are
handled by the SDK rather than a hand-written JSON-RPC loop.

The official remote MCP is configured in `.mcp.json` as:

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "url": "https://mcp.excalidraw.com/mcp"
}
```

The local MCP is configured in `.mcp.json` as:

```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["./mcp/server.mjs"],
  "cwd": "."
}
```

The stdio MCP starts the canvas automatically for canvas-writing tools. To open
the canvas manually:

```bash
./scripts/start-canvas.sh /path/to/user/project
```

The local HTTP MCP endpoint is still served by the browser canvas process at
`/mcp`, but it is token-protected. Read `canvas/.server.json` for the current
`mcpUrl` and bearer `token`.

For clients that need a direct stdio command:

```bash
./scripts/start-mcp.sh
```

Local tools include both official-compatible diagram tools and media tools:

- `read_me`: returns the official-compatible Excalidraw element format used by `create_view`
- `create_view`: accepts a JSON array string of Excalidraw-like elements and writes the diagram into the live local browser canvas
- `get_excalidraw_selection`: reads selected elements from `canvas/excalidraw-selection.json`
- `insert_excalidraw_image`: copies a local bitmap into `canvas/assets/`, adds an Excalidraw image file and element, and saves the scene
- `insert_excalidraw_video`: copies a local video into `canvas/assets/`, adds a Youtube-AGI-style video media element, and saves the scene
- `generate_excalidraw_image`: generates with `gpt-image-2-codex` or `grok-imagine-image-hermes`, inserts the result, and saves the scene
- `generate_excalidraw_video`: generates with `grok-imagine-video-hermes`, inserts a Youtube-AGI-style video media element, and saves the scene
- `generate_excalidraw_images_batch`: creates image generator frames first, then fills each frame with generated results as they finish
- `generate_excalidraw_videos_batch`: creates video generator frames first, then fills each frame with generated video media as results finish
- `generate_excalidraw_subtitles`: generates Japanese SRT subtitles from an audio file via BuzzAssist cloud (ElevenLabs forced alignment / Scribe v2), saves the SRT under `canvas/assets/`, and places an SRT card on the canvas
- `silence_cut_excalidraw_video`: removes silences from a Premiere XML or local video and writes a downloadable non-destructive Premiere XML under `canvas/assets/` (no rendered video/result card)
- `buzzassist_login`: browser sign-in to BuzzAssist for cloud models and cloud subtitles (token saved to `~/.buzzassist/excalidraw-media-auth.json`)
- `buzzassist_auth_status`: reports the current BuzzAssist sign-in state (warns when the token expires within 3 days)

Generation extras:

- `generate_excalidraw_image` / `generate_excalidraw_video` accept `payloadPreview: true` to return the resolved fal endpoint, request payload, and estimated BuzzAssist credits without generating (`lib/mediaCredits.mjs` ports the BuzzAssist rate card)
- `generate_excalidraw_subtitles` supports a two-step LLM segmentation flow: call with `returnWordsOnly: true` to get timed words, let the agent decide semantic line breaks, then call again with `subtitleLines` to render and place the SRT without a second cloud call
- 429 responses retry automatically with backoff; payload builders are covered by `node scripts/test-fal-payloads.mjs`

## Plugin Packaging

Codex uses `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; Claude Code uses
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Both manifests point at the shared `skills/`
folder and `.mcp.json`, so skills and MCP config are no longer duplicated under
tool-specific folders.

For Codex local testing, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exposes this repo
as `buzzassist`. For npm packaging, `package.json` provides:

```bash
npx buzzassist-canvas-mcp   # stdio MCP server
npx buzzassist-canvas       # local canvas web server
```

Run the verification suite before packaging:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Batch Generation

Generate many images or videos in one call. The MCP batch tools first place Youtube-AGI-style generator frames as a grid below existing canvas content, keep the user's current canvas view in place by default, then run jobs with bounded concurrency and replace each frame as its media result finishes.

MCP tools:

- `generate_excalidraw_images_batch`: `{ jobs: [{ prompt, model?, aspectRatio?, imageSize?, quality?, referenceImagePaths?, fileName? }], columns?=4, gap?=24, concurrency?=3, focusCreated?=false, projectDir?, canvasDir?, dryRun? }`
- `generate_excalidraw_videos_batch`: `{ jobs: [{ prompt, model?, aspectRatio?, duration?, resolution?, generateAudio?, referenceImagePaths?, fileName? }], columns?=3, gap?=24, concurrency?=1, focusCreated?=false, projectDir?, canvasDir?, dryRun? }`

Both return `{ ok, total, succeeded, failed, results: [{ prompt, elementId, fileId, bounds, error? }] }`.

HTTP endpoints (same backend, served by the canvas process):

```text
POST /api/generate/images/batch   { jobs, columns, gap, concurrency }
POST /api/generate/videos/batch   { jobs, columns, gap, concurrency }
```

Each endpoint runs the batch, saves the scene once, broadcasts a single live-canvas update, and responds with the per-job results array.

## Codex Agent Clarifications

When a Codex agent uses the Excalidraw MCP media tools, the MCP server instructions tell it to ask before generating if required media settings are missing instead of silently guessing defaults. Use the host AskUserQuestion/request_user_input flow for those questions.

The server also enforces this gate. Generation, subtitle, and paid silence-cut
tools reject calls without `confirmedSettings: true`, except for payload
previews and offline ffmpeg-local dry runs.

- Image generation should confirm missing model, aspect ratio, and quality. Recommended defaults: `GPT-Image-2.0(Codex)`, `1:1`, `Auto`.
- Video generation should confirm missing model, aspect ratio, duration, and resolution. Recommended defaults: `Grok Imagine(Hermes)`, `16:9`, `5s`, `720p`.
- If attached or selected media can be routed more than one way, ask before generation. For video, distinguish start frame/image-to-video from style reference.

## Media Generation Providers

The canvas UI and MCP tools use the same generation backend. Supported model IDs are aligned with the Youtube-AGI (BuzzAssist) Excalidraw bridge.

In the canvas UI, models appear once by canonical name (`lib/modelCatalog.mjs`) and the execution route — Codex / Hermes / BuzzAssist / Lovart — is picked per model from the 実行先 pill in the panel's settings row. The ⚡ generate button shows the pre-generation credit estimate for the selected route (0 for local routes, — for Lovart whose rates are external). The concrete backend model IDs below are what frames store and what MCP tools accept.

Local models (no BuzzAssist account needed):

```text
gpt-image-2-codex
grok-imagine-image-hermes
grok-imagine-video-hermes
```

BuzzAssist cloud models (billed through the BuzzAssist fal proxy; sign in first):

```text
nano-banana-2            gpt-image-2              seedream-v5-lite
grok-imagine-image-api   seedance-2               seedance-2-fast
kling-v3                 kling-o3                 kling-v2-6
grok-imagine-video-api
```

## Lovart Models

Lovart's Agent OpenAPI (issued from Lovart's OpenClaw settings) adds models the fal proxy does not have:

```text
images: lovart-midjourney  lovart-flux-2-max  lovart-nano-banana-pro  lovart-ideogram-v4  lovart-agent
videos: lovart-veo-3-1  lovart-veo-3-1-fast  lovart-hailuo-2-3  lovart-kling-3-omni  lovart-wan-2-6
```

Auth: set `LOVART_ACCESS_KEY` / `LOVART_SECRET_KEY`, or put `access_key` / `secret_key` in `~/.lovart/credentials.json` (0600). Requests are HMAC-SHA256 signed against `https://lgw.lovart.ai/v1/openapi` (`lib/lovartMediaGeneration.mjs`). Generation is prompt-driven (aspect ratio / duration are hints); results are billed in Lovart credits, generated inside a dedicated "BuzzAssist Excalidraw" Lovart project, and downloaded onto the canvas. High-cost confirmations are auto-approved by default (`autoConfirmCredits: false` to require explicit approval).

## BuzzAssist Sign-In

Cloud models, cloud subtitles, and their credits use your BuzzAssist account:

- MCP: run the `buzzassist_login` tool (opens the browser, loopback callback), check with `buzzassist_auth_status`
- HTTP: `GET/POST <canvas-url>/api/buzzassist/login`, status at `/api/buzzassist/auth-status`
- CI/headless: set `BUZZASSIST_MEDIA_TOKEN` with a desktop auth token

Tokens are desktop-app auth tokens (30-day TTL) stored at `~/.buzzassist/excalidraw-media-auth.json`. Credits are reserved and refunded server-side by the BuzzAssist proxy; failed generations refund automatically.

## Silence Cut / Subtitles

- `silence_cut_excalidraw_video` runs the BuzzAssist tempo-cut pipeline (ffmpeg-local mode) ported to `lib/tempoCut.mjs`: silencedetect with adaptive threshold fallback, margin/keep cutlist math, and a filter_complex jet-cut render. Requires `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`.
- `generate_excalidraw_subtitles` reserves subtitle credits, calls the BuzzAssist subtitle API (ElevenLabs forced alignment for scripted mode, Scribe v2 for scriptless), then builds SRT cues locally with the ported Japanese-aware segmentation (`lib/subtitleGeneration.mjs`).

## Folder-Canvas Storage

Same model as the Youtube-AGI (BuzzAssist) folder canvas: a canvas belongs to one project folder, and everything generated on it is written under that folder.

```text
<project>/
  canvas/excalidraw-canvas.json     # the canvas (BuzzAssist: the folder's .excalidraw canvas)
  canvas/excalidraw-selection.json
  canvas/excalidraw-view-state.json
  canvas/assets/                    # generated images, videos, SRT files (BuzzAssist: .excalidraw/)
  canvas/assets-trash/              # orphaned assets moved here by startup maintenance (recoverable)
```

Bind the canvas to a project with `./scripts/start-canvas.sh /path/to/project` (macOS/Linux), `node scripts/start-canvas.mjs /path/to/project` (any OS), or `EXCALIDRAW_PROJECT_DIR`. MCP tools take `projectDir` per call, so different projects keep separate canvases and assets.

Downloads: every media header has a ⬇ button (`/excalidraw-assets/<name>?download=1`); selecting two or more media shows a ZIP chip backed by `POST /api/assets/archive` (STORE-method ZIP, `lib/zipStore.mjs`). Select-all + chip = bulk export.

Maintenance: both servers run `performCanvasMaintenance` at startup (`lib/canvasScene.mjs`) — legacy inline base64 file records migrate to `canvas/assets/`, stale atomic-write `.tmp` files are removed, and assets referenced nowhere move to `canvas/assets-trash/`. `node scripts/cleanup-canvas.mjs [--dry-run]` removes empty generator frames (backs up the canvas first).

## Claude Code

The same repo works as-is in Claude Code: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.mcp.json` register the shared skills and MCP server. Start the canvas with `./scripts/start-canvas.sh`, then use the same MCP tools from Claude Code sessions.

`grok-imagine-image-hermes` and `grok-imagine-video-hermes` use the local Hermes Agent xAI OAuth flow:

```bash
hermes auth add xai-oauth --timeout 600
```

Optional environment variables:

```text
HERMES_PATH=/absolute/path/to/hermes
HERMES_HOME=/absolute/path/to/.hermes
HERMES_PROJECT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/hermes-agent
```

`gpt-image-2-codex` is a Codex bridge model, not a plain HTTP OpenAI API model in this standalone service. By default the canvas uses the bundled Codex app-server bridge at `scripts/codex-image-bridge.mjs`, which requires a working `codex` CLI login and the Codex `$imagegen` skill/tool path. You can still override it with one of these hooks:

```text
EXCALIDRAW_GPT_IMAGE_2_CODEX_COMMAND="node /path/to/codex-image-bridge.mjs"
EXCALIDRAW_GPT_IMAGE_2_CODEX_URL="http://127.0.0.1:PORT/generate-image"
```

The bridge receives JSON on stdin or via POST and should return one of:

```json
{ "mimeType": "image/png", "base64": "..." }
{ "image": "data:image/png;base64,..." }
{ "url": "https://..." }
{ "path": "/absolute/path/to/image.png" }
```

Hermes override hooks are also available for custom provider shims:

```text
EXCALIDRAW_GROK_IMAGE_HERMES_COMMAND="node /path/to/grok-image-bridge.mjs"
EXCALIDRAW_GROK_VIDEO_HERMES_COMMAND="node /path/to/grok-video-bridge.mjs"
```

## Codex Plugin Shape

The plugin metadata is in:

```text
.codex-plugin/plugin.json
.mcp.json
skills/
```

The local service intentionally does not store user canvas data inside the plugin repository. Pass the active project directory to `start-canvas.sh`, the same way Cowart separates plugin code from project-local canvas state.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The Excalidraw package pulls in large optional diagram/font chunks, so production build can take around 40-50 seconds on first runs.
